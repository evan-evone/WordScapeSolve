# WordScapeSolve

A simple Python script to solve WordScapes puzzles. Based on the [`pyenchant`][1]
spell-checker module---yes the module is outdated; for this simple application, that does
not matter.

Given a string of letters, prints all valid words of a certain length that can be made from
those letters.
